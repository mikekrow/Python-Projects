# CHATZLITE 3.0
A small txt file based secret chat program.


CHATZLITE is actually the smaller more compact version of CHATZ. (Which became a prime example of feature creep).
At any rate, CHATZLITE is to be used placed on your server and ran from there. I made it at work so we didn't have to use god aweful skype, which has a wonderful feature of making a copy of whatever you type with someone and sending it to all parties... so much for privacy. 

CHATZLITE is pretty simple to use. Just put it your shared server with a USERS and CHATZROOMZ folder and BAM! Now you can start taking to you coworkers without the 'man' knowing what you are talking about. 

It also has a feature I am pretty proud of which is you can change your CHATZROOMZ. Thats right if you are talking with one homie, you can switch to another chat room and talk there. Pretty cool, homie.

Key Features!

*Usernames! You get to choose your own user name! WOW!

*Text Color! So much customization! You get to choose your own text color to distigush from other users!

*Multiple Chatrooms! Now you can actually move to another chatroom! Wow, much options!

*Secret Chatrooms! If you don't want to talk to people in the public chats provide the direct path to your secret txt file! 

*日本語文字はOKです！

*Crypto at your finger tips! If you type the name of a crypto like this :bitcoin: or :ethereum: it will pull the price from https://api.coinmarketcap.com !
